# React Tech Loaders

A collection of **creative, futuristic, and tech-inspired React loader components** designed to transform boring loading screens into engaging, immersive experiences.

## Why Loaders Matter

Loading times—those critical milliseconds or seconds—can determine whether users stay or leave an app. Instead of leaving users staring at a boring spinner, these loaders add *suspense* and *excitement* while your content loads, turning wait times into memorable moments.

## Features

- **Hacker Terminal Loader:** Simulates a sci-fi terminal boot sequence with animated typing, flicker, glitch effects, and neon glows.
- **Pixel World Unfolding Loader:** Builds a pixel-art style world block-by-block as progress increases, with lively colors and smooth animations.
- **Neon Circular Loader:** A glowing neon circular progress bar with smooth stroke animations and pulsing tech vibes.
- Responsive and mobile-friendly designs.
- Clean React functional components with no heavy dependencies.
- Easy to integrate into any React or Next.js project.

## Demo

See live examples and GIFs in the repository or on the project demo page (add your demo link here if available).

## Installation

npm install react-tech-loaders
or
yarn add react-tech-loaders

## Usage

Import and use any loader component in your React app:
import React, { useState } from "react";
import HackerTerminalLoader from "react-tech-loaders/HackerTerminalLoader";

function App() {
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

return (
<>
{loading ? (
<HackerTerminalLoader onDone={() => setLoading(false)} />
) : (
<YourMainComponent />
)}
</>


Swap `HackerTerminalLoader` with `PixelWorldLoader` or `TechLoader` to try different styles.

## Props

- `onDone: () => void` (required) — A callback invoked when the loading finishes.

## Customization

- Customize colors, animation speeds, fonts, and styles by modifying component code.
- Add your own loading narratives or extra effects like sound, particles, or sparkle.
- Extend with more loaders that match your app’s branding and vibe.

## Contributing

- Open pull requests to add or improve loader components.
- Share your own creative loading screens inspired by tech, cyberpunk, gaming, or futuristic themes.
