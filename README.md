React Tech Loaders
A collection of creative, futuristic, and tech-inspired React loader components designed to transform boring loading screens into engaging, immersive experiences.

Why Loaders Matter
Loading times—those critical milliseconds or seconds—can determine whether users stay or leave an app. Instead of leaving users staring at a boring spinner, these loaders add suspense and excitement while your content loads, turning wait times into memorable moments.

Features
Hacker Terminal Loader: Simulates a sci-fi terminal boot sequence with animated typing, flicker, glitch effects, and neon glows.

Pixel World Unfolding Loader: Builds a pixel-art style world block-by-block as progress increases, with lively colors and smooth animations.

Neon Circular Loader: A glowing neon circular progress bar with smooth stroke animations and pulsing tech vibes.

Responsive and mobile-friendly designs.

Clean React functional components with no heavy dependencies.

Easy to integrate into any React or Next.js project.

Demo
See live examples and GIFs in the repository's demo folder or on the project page (link to demo if hosted).

Installation
bash
npm install react-tech-loaders
# or
yarn add react-tech-loaders
Usage
Import and use the desired loader component in your React app:

tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import HackerTerminalLoader from "react-tech-loaders/HackerTerminalLoader";

function App() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  return (
    <>
      {loading ? (
        <HackerTerminalLoader onDone={() => setLoading(false)} />
      ) : (
        <YourMainComponent />
      )}
    </>
  );
}
You can swap out HackerTerminalLoader with PixelWorldLoader or TechLoader to change the style easily.

Props
Each loader accepts:

onDone: () => void — required callback when loading completes, allowing you to toggle UI accordingly.

Customization
Modify colors, speeds, fonts, and animations by editing the component styles.

Extend with your own loading narratives and animations.

Integrate sound or additional effects as needed.
